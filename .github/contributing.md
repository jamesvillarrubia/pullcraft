# Contributing to this Module

Thank you for contributing to this MADI plugin! :heart: :tada:


## Report a bug

Before creating an issue please make sure you have checked out the docs. You might want to also try searching Github. It's pretty likely someone has already asked a similar question.

Issues can be reported in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jamesvillarrubia/pullcraft/issues). Since MADI combines many modules it can be hard for us to assess the root cause without knowing which modules are being used and what your configuration looks like, so **it helps us immensely if you can link to a simple example that reproduces your issue**.

## Report a Security Concern

We take security very seriously. We welcome any peer review of our 100% open source code to ensure nobody's app is ever compromised or hacked. As a web application developer you are responsible for any security breaches. We do our very best to make sure our code is as secure as possible by default.


## Pull Requests

We :heart: pull requests and we're continually working to make it as easy as possible for people to contribute.

We prefer small pull requests with minimal code changes. The smaller they are the easier they are to review and merge. A maintainer will pick up your PR and review it as soon as they can. They may ask for changes or reject your pull request. This is not a reflection of you as an engineer or a person. Please accept feedback graciously as we will also try to be sensitive when providing it.

Although we generally accept many PRs they can be rejected for many reasons. We will be as transparent as possible but it may simply be that you do not have the same context, historical knowledge or information regarding the roadmap that the maintainers have. We value the time you take to put together any contributions so we pledge to always be respectful of that time and will try to be as open as possible so that you don't waste it. :smile:

**All PRs (except documentation) should be accompanied with tests and pass the linting rules.**

### Code style

Before running the tests from the `test/` folder `npm test` will run ESlint. You can check your code changes individually by running `npm run lint`.

### Tests

Tests are located in the `test/` folder and can be run using the `npm run mocha` or `npm test` (with ESLint and code coverage) command.

### Documentation

Documentation is contained in Markdown files in the [docs](https://github.com/jamesvillarrubia/pullcraft/docs) repository. To change the documentation submit a pull request to that repo, referencing any other PR if applicable, and the docs will be updated with the next release.
